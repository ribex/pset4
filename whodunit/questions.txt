1.  stdint.h is a library that defines a variety of integer types. The attributes include signed/unsigned,
    exact-width/minimum-width, integers wide enough to hold pointers, and others.
2.  We use these standardized integer types because different hardware would otherwise handle an "int" differently.
3.  BYTE: 1 byte  DWORD: 4 bytes  LONG: 8 bytes   WORD: 2 bytes
4.  424d (hexadecimal)
5.  biSize is the number of bytes required by the bitmapinfoheader structure, while bfSize is the size of the bitmap
    file in bytes
6.  if BiHeight is negative, the image starts in the upper left corner and is a top down bitmap
7.  biBitCount specifies the BMPâ€™s color depth, and the value range is from 0 to 32 (but not all values are used)
8.  In line 24, NULL might be returned if the file does not match a valid filename, if the file is corrupt, or
    otherwise cannot be opened. In line 32, NULL might be returned if the file cannot be created.
9.  The third argument to fread is always '1' in this code because we always want to ready just one byte at a time.
10. The value assigned to padding would be 3.
11. fseek skips over padding by moving the file pointer position
12. SEEK_CUR is a constant that refers to the current location in the file.
